# AMRWatch
This ongoing project hopes to build a prototype that monitors antimicrobial resistance trends by integrating genomic predictions and phenotypic data. While real-time alerts depend on sequencing availability, the system demonstrates a scalable workflow for early detection of resistance patterns.
